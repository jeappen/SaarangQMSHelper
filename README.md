## What is this repo for? ###

This is the Android Studio version of the Quality Managment Services (QMS) Helper Android application used during Saarang 2015, the cultural fest of IIT Madras. This was developed during my second year.

### Features
* Communicates with the Saarang server to register new participants at the festival.
* Can register participants at an Event given an Event list from the server. Stores and exports the details as a CSV file.
* Integrates a barcode scanning library (ZXing) for scanning the ID Card given to participants speeding up the event registration procedure.

###To Use
